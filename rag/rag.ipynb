    "##### How does RAG improve the quality and reliability of LLM responses compared to pure LLM generation?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of the PDF used, both RAG and LLM responses are quite brief. However, RAG is slightly more aligned with the content of the document, while LLM focuses more on general information. This results in better outcomes for some answers and worse for others. Overall, the performance is OK in my opinion.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### What are the key factors affecting RAG performance (chunk size, embedding quality, prompt design)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Factors affecting RAG performance include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Chunk size: Smaller chunks provide more information but can also introduce more noise.\n",
    "Embeddings model: A better model yields better results.\n",
    "LLM model: Higher-quality models produce better outcomes.\n",
    "Questions: Better-formulated questions lead to better answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### How does the choice of vector database and embedding model impact system performance?\n",
    "A poor embeddings database can result in slower model performance or incorrect answers if the embedding dimensions are too small. An unsuitable embeddings model may lead to chunks lacking essential information and incorrect classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### What are the main challenges in implementing a production-ready RAG system?\n",
    "Challenges include ensuring database consistency, aligning embeddings with the problem, and managing search times for large databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### How can the system be improved to handle complex queries requiring multiple document lookups?\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement multi-hop search.\n",
    "Use document clustering to enhance query-specific search.\n",
    "Apply reranking techniques to achieve more precise results."
